                    <p class='aboutme-info'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a recent graduate of Flatiron School's 
                    Software Engineering program and a growth-oriented fullstack 
                    developer hoping to bring a strong commitment to code, 
                    collaboration, and creative problem solving to an organization 
                    with a culture of camaraderie and advancement.
                    </p>
                      
                    <p class='aboutme-info'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first experience with code was in 2019. I took 2 semesters of 
                      Python at University of Houston-Downtown&mdash;intro to Python and Data 
                      structures and algorithms with Python. I was completely captivated 
                      by Python and programming in general and I started researching 
                      for ways to continue my coding journey. Eventually, I heard about 
                      Flatiron School and I immediately applied for the Software Engineering program. 
                      Luckily, transitioning from Python to Ruby as a high-level language with 
                      frameworks for creating backends wasn't hard. I had no web development 
                      experience with Python, but I had learned the basics of the language 
                      and object oriented programming, so transferring those skills 
                      allowed me to quickly grasp Ruby and then move on to conquer Rails as 
                      a backend.

                    <p class='aboutme-info'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Javascript was completely new to me, 
                      but I found that with consistent 
                      study I was able to harness the power of JS and combine it with 
                      React to develop some pretty cool apps.
                    </p>

                    <p class='aboutme-info'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my free time I really like to read, stream 
                      Netflix, and learn new developer 
                      skills/technologies.
